  - AI content engine integration (backend microservice, frontend UI)
  - Analytics dashboard (backend endpoints, frontend charts)
  - Scheduling and calendar module
- **Phase 3: Testing & Quality**
  - Add comprehensive backend tests for all endpoints and flows
  - Add frontend tests for all major components and flows
  - Set up E2E tests for critical user journeys
- **Phase 4: Polish & Documentation**
  - Refine UI/UX and accessibility
  - Add user and developer documentation for all new features
  - Review and update all guides, logs, and project board
- **Phase 5: Advanced Features**
  - OAuth2 for social APIs (Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.)
  - Plugin system for extensibility
  - Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
  - NLP & predictive analytics
  - Observability (logging, monitoring, tracing)
  - Security & compliance (encryption, GDPR)
