- **Cloud-Native**: Leverage cloud platforms for storage, compute, and CI/CD (Burns et al., 2016).

### 2.2. Artificial Intelligence
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For content generation, sentiment analysis, and moderation (Vaswani et al., 2017).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: For optimizing posting schedules and engagement (Sutton & Barto, 2018).
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: For distributed, collaborative automation (Wooldridge, 2009).

### 2.3. User Experience (UX)
- **Human-Centered Design**: Iterative prototyping and user feedback (Norman, 2013).
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for inclusivity.
- **Personalization**: Adaptive interfaces using AI-driven recommendations.

### 2.4. Scalability & Reliability
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: For real-time updates and notifications.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and tracing (Sigelman et al., 2010).

### 2.5. Security & Privacy
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: Secure authentication with social platforms.
- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit.
- **GDPR Compliance**: User data rights and transparency.
